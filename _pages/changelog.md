# Release Notes

Note that I follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) which means that the `major` (first) number in a version like `1.0.0` will only change if there's either a breaking change with something like the config file format (users with the old version then wouldn't be able to open the file saved with the new version), or if there's a significant change in the usage flow of the app (so users need to change their habits). A **migration guide** will be provided on this page for every breaking change.


## üêû [1.2.2] - 2022-12-21
