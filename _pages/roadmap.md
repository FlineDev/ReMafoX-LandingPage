# Roadmap

I am an Indie Developer and I want to develop and maintain multiple apps. Some of them are small-scoped one-off app ideas, but this is one of the larger scoped projects with potential for more features. For projects like this, I try to provide exactly **1 new feature per month** (there's no limit on bug fixes). By voting on [bug reports](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX-Feedback/issues/new?labels=Bug+Report&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+%3Cyour+bug+title%3E) and [feature requests](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX-Feedback/issues/new?labels=Feature+Request&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeat%5D+%3Cyour+feature+title%3E) (via üëç), you help me prioritize.

This page lists all bugs & features I'm planning to work on within the next 3 months.
