# Roadmap

I am an Indie Developer and I want to develop and maintain multiple apps. Some of them are small-scoped one-off app ideas, but this is one of the larger scoped projects with potential for more features. For projects like this, I try to provide at least **1 new feature per month**.

By [voting on bugs & features](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated+is%3Aopen) (via üëç), you help me prioritize.
New ideas are always welcome!

The following is a list of the features I'm planning to work on within the next 6 months.


## May '23 Feature Update

* [Easy way of inviting others to verify translations](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/13)
* [Flexible Pricing](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/79)


## June '23 Feature Update

* [Secret features that will also reveal the meaning of the app's name](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/discussions/19)


## July '23 Feature Update

* [Provide a list of validated common translations](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/55)


## Planned for Later (Selection)

* [Specialized Strings file editor](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/12)
* [Special UI for localizing Info.plist](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/35)
* [Provide a bulk translation workflow for all Strings in a file](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/18)
