# Roadmap

I am an Indie Developer and I want to develop and maintain multiple apps. Some of them are small-scoped one-off app ideas, but this is one of the larger scoped projects with potential for more features. For projects like this, I try to provide at least **1 new feature per month** (& as many bug fixes as possible).

By [voting on bug reports and feature requests](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated+is%3Aopen) (via üëç), you help me prioritize.
New ideas are always welcome!

The following is a list of the features I'm planning to work on within the next 3 months.

## October Update

* [[Feat] Add full support for Ventura](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues/9)
