# Roadmap

By [voting on bugs & features](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated+is%3Aopen) (via üëç), you help me prioritize.
New ideas are always welcome!

The following is a list of the features I'm planning to work on next:

* [Easy way of inviting others to verify translations](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/13)
* [Flexible Pricing](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/79)
* [Provide a list of validated common translations](https://github.com/FlineDev/RemafoX/issues/55)
