# Roadmap

I am an Indie Developer and I want to develop and maintain multiple apps. Some of them are small-scoped one-off app ideas, but this is one of the larger scoped projects with potential for more features. For projects like this, I try to provide at least **1 new feature per month**.

By [voting on bugs & features](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated+is%3Aopen) (via üëç), you help me prioritize.
New ideas are always welcome!

The following is a list of the features I'm planning to work on within the next 6 months.

## November '22 Update

* [Provide a bulk translation workflow for all Strings in a file](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues/18)
* [Pro Tier for Open Source projects for Free](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues/10)

## December '22 Update

* [Add support for Google Translate service](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues/11)
* [Add support for Yandex translation service](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues/4)

## January '23 Update

* [Support more languages than the current 40](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues/39)
* [Provide auto-completion for keys for reusing same prefixes](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues/22)

## Planned for Later (Selection)

* [Machine-translate Fastlane App Store text files](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/issues/14)
